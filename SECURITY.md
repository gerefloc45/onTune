Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to [security@ontune.bot](mailto:security@ontune.bot)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Discord**: Contact the maintainers directly on our Discord server (for urgent issues)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress. If you have not received a response to your email within 48 hours, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

1. **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We will release the fix and publish a security advisory

   - Use secure hosting providers
   - Enable two-factor authentication where possible

4. **Configuration Security**
   - Validate all configuration inputs
   - Use secure defaults
   - Regularly review configuration settings

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use role-based access control
   - Validate permissions for all operations

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper data retention policies
   - Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations
